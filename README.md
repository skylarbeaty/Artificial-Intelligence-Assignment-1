# Artificial Intelligence Assignment 1
 Implimentation of BFS and recursive DFS on a given graph

This is an implimented as a basic C# console app. The easiest way to run it is to open the [solution](AI_Assignment1/AI_Assignment1.sln) in Visual Studio (I'm using Community, 2017), and just press the run button â–¶ or F5.

The code itself can be found at AI_Assignment1/AI_Assignment1/ [Program.cs](AI_Assignment1/AI_Assignment1/Program.cs)

The graph for the homework is setup in the driver. The output is it each node calling out when it is visited, to the difference between this in DFS and BFS.

example output:
~~~
Running BFS Search
Visited Node A
Visited Node B
Visited Node C
Visited Node D
Visited Node E
Visited Node F
Running DFS recursive Search
Visited Node A
Visited Node C
Visited Node E
Visited Node F
Visited Node D
Visited Node B
